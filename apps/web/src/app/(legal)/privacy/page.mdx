# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 30, 2025**

## The Short Version

OpenSheets is open source software. We don't collect, store, or sell your data. Your spreadsheet data stays in your spreadsheet.

## Data Collection

**We don't collect any personal data.** OpenSheets runs entirely in your browser (for the web version) or within Google's Apps Script environment (for the Google Sheets™ add-on). We have no servers that collect or store your information.

### What stays on your device/session:

- Your spreadsheet data
- Your API keys (stored locally, never transmitted to us)
- Your conversation history
- All settings and preferences

## Data Usage

OpenSheets accesses the following Google user data:

- **Spreadsheet data**: Cell values, formulas, and formatting are read to provide context to the AI assistant and written to execute user-requested changes.
- **User email and profile**: Displayed in the sidebar to show which account is active. This information is never stored or transmitted.

**How we use this data:**
- Spreadsheet data is sent to Anthropic's Claude API (the AI provider) to process your natural language requests
- The AI generates a response with suggested changes
- Changes are applied to your spreadsheet only after you approve them
- No data is stored on our servers — we have no servers

## Third-Party AI Services

OpenSheets integrates with **Anthropic's Claude API** for AI processing. When you use OpenSheets:

1. Your prompt and relevant spreadsheet context are sent to Anthropic's API
2. You must provide your own Anthropic API key
3. Anthropic processes the request and returns a response

**Important:** Anthropic does NOT use API data to train their AI models. See [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) and [API Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/api-terms).

We do not integrate with OpenAI or any other AI provider that may use customer data for model training.

## Data Storage & Protection

**We do not store your data.** OpenSheets has no backend servers or databases.

- Your API keys are stored locally in your browser or Google Apps Script properties
- Conversation history exists only in your browser session
- Spreadsheet data remains in your Google Sheets™ document
- All communication with Anthropic's API uses HTTPS encryption

Since we don't collect or store data, there is no data to protect on our end. Your data protection is handled by:
- Google (for your spreadsheet data)
- Anthropic (for API communications)
- Your browser (for local storage)

## Data Retention & Deletion

**We retain no user data.** Since OpenSheets doesn't collect or store any data on external servers, there is nothing to retain or delete.

- **Spreadsheet data**: Controlled entirely by you within Google Sheets™
- **API keys**: Stored locally; delete by clearing browser storage or removing the add-on
- **Conversation history**: Session-based; cleared when you close the sidebar or refresh

**To remove all local data:**
1. Uninstall the OpenSheets add-on from Google Sheets™
2. Clear your browser's local storage for opensheets.app

If you have any questions about data deletion, contact us and we'll assist you.
